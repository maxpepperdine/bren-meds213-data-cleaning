# Cleaning the shorebird survey data 


## The data set

ARCTIC SHOREBIRD DEMOGRAPHICS NETWORK [https://doi.org/10.18739/A2222R68W](https://doi.org/10.18739/A2222R68W)

Data set hosted by the [NSF Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io) data repository 

Field data on shorebird ecology and environmental conditions were collected from 1993-2014 at 16 field sites in Alaska, Canada, and Russia.

Data were not collected every year at all sites. Studies of the population ecology of these birds included nest-monitoring to determine the timing of reproduction and reproductive success; live capture of birds to collect blood samples, feathers, and fecal samples for investigations of population structure and pathogens; banding of birds to determine annual survival rates; resighting of color-banded birds to determine space use and site fidelity; and use of light-sensitive geolocators to investigate migratory movements. 

Data on climatic conditions, prey abundance, and predators were also collected. Environmental data included weather stations that recorded daily climatic conditions, surveys of seasonal snowmelt, weekly sampling of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates that are prey of shorebirds, live trapping of small mammals (alternate prey for shorebird predators), and daily counts of potential predators (jaegers, falcons, foxes). Detailed field methods for each year are available in the `ASDN_protocol_201X.pdf` files. All research was conducted under permits from relevant federal, state, and university authorities.

# Metadata for the cleaned snow survey data (week 7 metadata assignment)

## DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

#### (1) File list contained in the dataset

There are other files contained in this repository that aren't directly related to the snow cover data. Here is the structure/organization for the files specific to the snow survey data. 

```
├── data  
|   └── processed
|       └── all_cover_fixed_Maxwell_Pepperdine.csv        # file with the cleaned snow survey data
|       └── snow_cover.csv                                # file containing only the cleaned snow cover variable
|   └── raw
|       └── 01_ASDN_Readme.txt                            # full metadata for the ASDN data set

├── eds213_data_cleaning_assign_Maxwell_Pepperdine.qmd    # Quarto document used to clean the snow cover data
├── README.md                                             # ASDN metadata specific to snow cover data

```

#### (2) Relationship between files

The raw `snow survey` data (`data/raw/ASDN_Snow_survey.csv`) was downloaded and cleaned in R. The raw data was first cleaned to only fix the `Snow_cover` column, producing the following file: `data/processed/snow_cover.csv`. 

The `snow_cover.csv` file was then uploaded and cleaned in the `eds213_data_cleaning_assign_Maxwell_Pepperdine.qmd` script to clean the `Water_cover`, `Land_cover`, and `Total_cover` columns. The cleaned data was then saved as a CSV file in this repository (`data/processed/all_cover_fixed_Maxwell_Peperdine.csv`). 

#### (3) Additionl related data collected not included in the current data package

There are no additional related data collected that were not included in the current data package.

#### (4) Are there multiple versions of the dataset?

There are three versions of the `snow survey` dataset, one raw and two cleaned versions. The raw data is located here: `data/raw/ASDN_Snow_survey.csv`

One of the cleaned versions of the data has only the `Snow_cover` variable cleaned (`data/processed/snow_cover.csv`). The other cleaned version (`data/processed/all_cover_fixed_Maxwell_Peperdine.csv`) was generated by uploading the `snow_cover.csv` file and cleaning the `Water_cover`, `Land_cover`, and `Total_cover` variables in the `eds213_data_cleaning_assign_Maxwell_Pepperdine.qmd` script. 

## DATA SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: 

For the file: `data/processed/all_cover_fixed_Maxwell_Peperdine.csv`

#### (1) Number of variables: `11`

#### (2) Number of cases/rows: `42831`

#### (3) Variable list and description

The cleaned data file contains the following columns/variables:

```
├── Site          # Four-letter code of site at which data were collected
├── Year          # Year in which data were collected      
├── Date          # Date on which data were collected (DD-MM-YY)                   
├── Plot          # Name of study plot on which survey was conducted
├── Location      # Name of dedicated snow-survey location (if applicable)
├── Snow_cover    # Percent cover of snow, including slush (%)
├── Water_cover   # Percent cover of water (%)
├── Land_cover    # Percent cover of exposed land (%)
├── Total_cover   # Total sum of cover types (to check the above, should sum to 100) (%)

```

#### (4) Missing data codes 

In the `data/processed/all_cover_fixed_Maxwell_Peperdine.csv` file, missing data are identified with `NA` values. We converted the following code/symbols in the raw data (`data/raw/ASDN_Snow_survey.csv`) to `NA` values in the cleaned data (`data/processed/all_cover_fixed_Maxwell_Peperdine.csv`) file:

- `.`
- `-`
- `n/a`
- `unk`
- `<0` values
- `<row r=\\64\\ spans=\\1:11\\ x14ac:dyDescent=\\0.2\\>`
